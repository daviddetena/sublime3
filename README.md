#Sublime 3

##First steps
The first thing you'll need to do is to get PHP 7, MySQL, Python & [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed in order to use some useful add-ons for Sublime 3.

##Tuning up Sublime 3
Sublime has a [package control](https://packagecontrol.io) repository where you can find a lot of add-ons to boost ST capabilities. The following ones have been selected to improve productivity, including web, PHP and MySQL features.

* **[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)**: The very 1st you'll need to install for ST3. Here you can find its [installation instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). Once installed, you can install/uninstall packages. Run **cmd + shift + p** on MacOS X (**ctrl + shift + p** on Windows/Linux) and type "install", select **Package Control : Install Package** option. Then type the package you want to install.


###Themes
